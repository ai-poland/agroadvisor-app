# Welcome to AgroAdvisor's Mobile app!

AgroAdvisor is an app designed for farmers and people in the agricultrural community with a goal to break the barriers between satellite data and these individuals. Satellite data can be very benefical, as it contains cruicial metrics like soil moisture or evapotranspiration that can later be used to make informed decisions to get ready for situations like floods or droughts.
